# TestJavaToKotlin
- Converted a project that was originally started in Java to the ability to use Kotlin. 
- Please see files build.gradle[Module:app] AND build.gradle[Project:TestJavaToKotlin]. 
- Take note of all comments. 
- Also, check out the Kotlin class that I have added as well as the MainActivity.java

Please note: It is not recommended to mix both .java and .kt files in the same project do the confusion it will eventually cause.
The java syntax and kotlin syntax is written completely different despite it all being compiled down to the same bytecode.
It is recommended, if you plan to use kotlin in your project, to simply convert all java files into its kotlin syntax.
